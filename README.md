# Apache-hudi-notes

## What is the purpose of this repo?
The idea behind this repository is to share my personal notes as I take on this new journey of learning [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org).

## Table of Contents
- What is Apache Hudi?
- Apache Hudi Concepts
  - Hudi Timeline

## What to expect from this repo?
1. I will be sharing my notes by end of each week. So, you should see the repo updated every Monday EST time.
2. The idea behind the notes is to be concise. I will list out the important points along with any diagramatic representations.
3. There might be some ü™Ñ Tips/Tricks in each module. This is to highlight anything that I think might be helpful to the readers.
4. There are chances that I might have some doubts or questions in each module. I will add them under the ‚ùìQ&A section.

## What not to expect from this repo?
This repository isn't part of the official Apache Hudi project or documentation. There might be some differences in my understanding of concepts which can reflect on the notes.

## Goal
My goal is to learn about data lakehouse table formats and educate the data community around it to help them build robust data platforms. I spent quite some time in the past 2 years learning about [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org) and writing/speaking about it. At times, I may therefore draw comparisons with other table formats. Overall, my motivation is to learn & grow together with the community. This is a step towards that.
